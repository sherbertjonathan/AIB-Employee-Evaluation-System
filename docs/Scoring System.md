# Annual Evaluation Scoring System

## Scoring System Components
The evaluation will be based on two main categories: **Technical Skills** (related to operating the equipment) and **Core Professional Skills** (related to general work performance).

### Technical Skills Score
(Maximum: 75 x Number of Operations Assessed)
For each operation an employee is assessed on, the score will be calculated as the product of the following three variables:

Variable & Scale Description:
**Difficulty Score (D)**
(1, 2, or 3) - Plant-defined score for the inherent complexity and importance of the operation.

**Skill Level (S)**
1 (Novice) to 5 (Expert) - Assesses the employee's knowledge of the procedures, safety protocols, and technical aspects of the operation.

**Proficiency (P)**
1 (Poor) to 5 (Excellent) - Assesses the employee's execution—speed, quality, consistency, and ability to troubleshoot independently.

Maximum Operation Score	3 x 5 x 5 = 75 (The maximum possible score for any single operation)

The Score for a Single Operation **O = D x S x P**.

### Core Professional Skills Score
(Maximum: 5 x 3 = 15)
These are critical to overall success regardless of the specific equipment operated.

Variable & Scale Description
**Attendance**
1 to 5 - Based on policy adherence (e.g., number of unexcused absences, tardiness).

**Productivity**
1 to 5 - Meets deadlines, output quantity, efficiency, and resource utilization.

**Attitude/Teamwork**
1 to 5	Adherence to safety culture, willingness to help peers, communication, and professionalism.

Total Core Professional Skills Score C = Attendance + Productivity + Attitude/Teamwork.

## Calculating the Annual Employee Score
To ensure fairness, especially since not all employees are assessed on all operations, we must calculate a weighted average for the Technical Skills Score.

### Technical Skills Calculation

**Calculate the Total Operation Score Earned (∑O):**
Sum up the scores for all operations the employee was assessed on.

∑O = O1 + O2 + O3 +…

**Calculate the Total Possible Operation Score (∑Omax):**
For each operation the employee was assessed on, calculate the maximum possible score (which is D x 25, since Smax = 5 and Pmax = 5).

∑Omax = (D1 x 25) + (D2 x 25) +…

**Calculate the Technical Skills Percentage (T%):**
This converts their raw score into a comparable percentage.

T% = (∑Omax / ∑O) x 100

### Final Annual Evaluation Score (AES)
To combine the two categories, we assign a weight to each. A standard starting point is 80% for Technical Skills and 20% for Core Professional Skills, as the operator role is primarily technical. You can adjust these weights as needed.

AES = (T% x 0.80) + ( C x 4)

Note: Since the maximum C score is 15, multiplying it by 4 creates a maximum of 60, which scales its 20% weight effectively with the T% maximum of 100.

## Promotion and Maintenance Criteria
This final step defines the requirements for moving between levels and staying there. This is where we connect the scores to the different job roles.

A. The Requirement: Must Be Able to Perform
A critical addition to the scoring is a minimum requirement for proficiency on a certain number of Level 2 and Level 3 difficulty operations. An operator must demonstrate mastery of the more challenging equipment and/or operations to qualify for a higher-tier role.

B. Suggested Level Requirements
| Role | Minimum Total AES | Must Maintain AES | Key Technical Requirements
Production Operator I | N/A (Entry Level) | 60% | Must successfully complete basic safety and introductory training.
Production Operator II | 70% | 65% | Proficient (Skill S ≥ 3 and Proficiency P ≥ 3) on a minimum of 3 Difficulty Level 2 operations.
Production Operator III | 80% | 75% | Proficient (Skill S ≥ 3 and Proficiency P ≥ 3) on a minimum of 3 Difficulty Level 3 operation AND 5 Difficulty Level 2 operations.
Senior Operator | 90% | 85% | Expert (Skill S ≥ 4 and Proficiency P ≥ 4) on a minimum of 5 Difficulty Level 3 operations AND must meet the Core Professional Skills score of C ≥ 12.

C. Maintenance and Documentation
Maintenance: An employee who drops below the "Must Maintain AES" in their annual review would be put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) to raise their score within a set timeframe (e.g., 3-6 months). Failure to improve could result in a demotion.

Documentation: The results of this system provide perfect documentation. The detailed scores for each operation and the final AES are objective data points to justify promotions, raises, and any necessary corrective action.

Next Steps
Your next critical step is to define the difficulty scores (D) for every single operation in your plant. This must be done thoughtfully and consistently across all departments. You should also clearly define what constitutes a 3, 4, or 5 for the Skill and Proficiency variables so that all assessors are grading to the same standard.

Do you want to start drafting a quick rubric for the Skill and Proficiency variables to help standardize the grading across your plant?








Yes


That is an excellent next step. Defining clear rubrics for Skill Level (S) and Proficiency (P) is crucial for ensuring the objectivity and fairness of your entire scoring system.

Here are draft rubrics for both variables, using the 1 to 5 scale, that you can adapt for your specific plant environment.

Rubric for Technical Skill Level (S)
Definition: Assesses the employee's knowledge of the procedures, safety protocols, mechanical function, and technical theory behind the operation.

Score	Description	Example Indicators
1 (Novice)	Minimal Knowledge. Requires constant instruction. Cannot describe the basic function or critical safety steps.	Cannot identify major controls; unaware of lockout/tagout (LOTO) points; fails basic written knowledge checks.
2 (Trainee)	Basic Understanding. Can perform simple steps with supervision. Has a conceptual understanding but lacks detail.	Can start/stop the equipment, but cannot explain the underlying process or common failure modes.
3 (Competent)	Solid Knowledge. Understands the standard operating procedure (SOP), safety, and function. Can explain why steps are taken.	Can clearly articulate SOPs; understands product quality standards; knows basic troubleshooting logic.
4 (Advanced)	Deep Understanding. Understands complex adjustments, maintenance needs, and process interactions. Can train others on procedures.	Understands internal machine mechanisms; can identify and explain how adjustments impact downstream processes; knows non-routine maintenance.
5 (Expert)	Mastery & Theory. Complete command of all aspects, including machine design principles and advanced diagnostics. Can write or improve SOPs.	Can diagnose complex intermittent faults; understands the machine's failure limits; can propose and execute process improvements.

Rubric for Operational Proficiency (P)
Definition: Assesses the employee's execution—speed, quality, consistency, independence, and ability to handle non-routine situations.

Score	Description	Example Indicators
1 (Poor)	Cannot Execute. Requires direct, step-by-step supervision. Execution is slow, inconsistent, or results in poor quality.	Frequently makes critical errors; requires constant checking; high scrap/rework rate when performing the operation.
2 (Developing)	Needs Supervision. Can follow the SOP but is slow and inconsistent. Requires frequent checks and struggles with minor deviations.	Execution is hesitant; struggles to maintain pace/cycle time; requires intervention for minor stoppages.
3 (Effective)	Independent & Consistent. Meets quality and speed standards. Can operate the equipment independently under normal conditions.	Consistently meets cycle time goals; rarely produces defects; handles routine setups and changeovers without help.
4 (Highly Proficient)	Fast & Adaptable. Consistently exceeds production targets. Can quickly and correctly diagnose and fix most common faults independently.	Execution is fluid and efficient; preemptively adjusts settings to avoid issues; quick and effective troubleshooting, minimizing downtime.
5 (Exemplary)	Benchmark Performer. Sets the standard for speed, quality, and uptime. Highly effective at handling major faults, optimizing performance, and mentoring others.	Maintains near-perfect quality/uptime; completes complex changeovers faster than the standard; operation is transparently flawless.

Rubric for Core Professional Skills (C)
You also need a simple rubric for the Core Professional Skills, since they are scored 1 to 5 as a separate component.

Score	Description
1	Unacceptable. Consistently fails to meet minimum standards and requires disciplinary action.
2	Needs Improvement. Does not consistently meet minimum standards; performance often negatively impacts the team/schedule.
3	Meets Expectations. Consistently meets all job requirements and plant standards. A reliable performer.
4	Exceeds Expectations. Regularly surpasses standards; demonstrates initiative and a strong positive impact.
5	Outstanding. Serves as a role model; performance is exceptional and consistently contributes to overall success.
